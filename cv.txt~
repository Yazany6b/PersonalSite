A motivated, self-starter, organized and reliable individual who believes in hard-work, ethics, hierarchy and the value of expertise exchange. As a graduate student from the Software Engineering department at Jordan University of Science and Technology (a leading public university in Jordan; founded in 1986) I’m seeking for useful knowledge and practice in game development as it’s the subject that it was since 14 my most interest and now I’m planning to purse my ambition to become a talented game developer and get hired at a reputable IT company.
